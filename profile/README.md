## about us

Welcome to the world of GSG-Miners, a dynamic team of young innovators and technology enthusiasts from the GSG Freiberg Gymnasium. With a passion for microelectronics and programming, we embark on exciting journeys of autonomous robot development using modern technology, particularly Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

Our team consists of four talented and motivated members, all of whom are currently in 10th grade at GSG Freiberg. In addition to our dedicated team, we are fortunate to have the guidance and support of two experienced coaches who play a crucial role in advancing our skills and supporting our pursuit of excellence.

After honing our expertise over the course of a year in the field of microelectronics and programming, we are proud of our amazing achievements in a prestigious competition.
In 2023, we reached an incredible milestone by taking third place in the Regional Finals of the World Robot Olympiad. The competition was tough, but our passion and determination led us to success. This challenge not only validated our knowledge and skills, but also motivated us to push our limits further.

As we continue to explore new horizons and expand our knowledge, our vision remains clear - to make new connections with other enthusiastic software developers and make it to the national or rather international finals of the WorldRobotOlympiad.
